# ControlNet for Affordance based Style Transfer

ControlNet is a neural network structure to control diffusion models by adding extra conditions.

It copys the weights of neural network blocks into a "locked" copy and a "trainable" copy. 

The "trainable" one learns the condition. The "locked" one preserves the model. 


# Usage

First create a new conda environment

    conda env create -f environment.yaml
    conda activate control
